This code provides a basic implementation of GitHub authentication using Passport.js in an Express.js application. 

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:

1. Change the value of **GITHUB_CLIENT_ID** in the **.env.template** file to the Client ID generated by GitHub. Also, update the value of **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET** with your Client Secret.

2. Install the required packages by running **npm install** in the project directory.

3. Configure the necessary settings in the code:
- [ ] Import the required modules and packages.
- [ ] Initialize an Express.js application.
- [ ] Set up the views directory and the view engine.
- [ ] Configure session management.
- [ ] Configure Passport.js with the GitHub authentication strategy.
- [ ] Implement the necessary passport serialization and deserialization functions.

4. Define the routes and their corresponding handlers:
- [ ] Define the home route **(/)** to render the index page.
- [ ] Define the account route **(/account)** to render the account page, protected by the ensureAuthenticated middleware.
- [ ] Define the login route **(/login)** to render the login page.
- [ ] Define the logout route **(/logout)** to log out the user and redirect to the home page.
- [ ] Define the GitHub authentication route **(/auth/github)** to initiate the GitHub authentication process.
- [ ] Define the GitHub authentication callback route **(/auth/github/callback)** to handle the callback from GitHub after successful authorization.

5. Additional details:
- The **ensureAuthenticated** middleware is used to verify if a request is authenticated. It protects the **/account** route and redirects to the login page if not authenticated.
- When a user visits **/auth/github**, they will be redirected to GitHub for authorization. After successful authorization, GitHub will redirect back to the callback URL specified.
- The code logs the server's listening port to the console.

Remember to create a **.env** file and populate it with the actual values for **GITHUB_CLIENT_ID** and **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET**.
